# SmashOut

## Background and Overview

SmashOut is a game based on the classic Atari game Breakout

Users progress through levels of increasing difficulty by attempting to use a paddle to bounce a ball into brick objects to destroy them. If the ball flies past the user's paddle, the game ends.

Each time the ball hits a brick or the paddle there is an accompanying visual and audio experience, which will be cool.

## Functionality & MVP

 * Users can control the paddle and reflect the ball
 * Ball destroys bricks and bounces back
 * Score points when bricks are destroyed
 * Play sound when the ball destroys bricks or encounters the paddle
